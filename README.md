# Arduino-Remote-Motor-Control
The sketch allows you to turn on and off a stepper motor using a remote.

The components needed for this sketch to work are a arduino board, stepper motor, an IR sensor, and any remote control.
Once you setup the motor and the IR sensor, run the sketch and open up the Serial monitor and get any working remote control.
To configure your remote, press a button and see what HEX code comes up on the Serial monitor, and change the switch/case accordingly.
